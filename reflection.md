I like inheritance, and how it makes writing new classes more efficient and easier to organize. For this assignment, it was helpful to read all of the instructions to understand what the difference was between each of the types of buildings. Overall, I enjoyed this assignment and it was fun to figure out the best method to use for different types of objects.
